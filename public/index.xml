      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a multitude of options and products to help turn your standard television into a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; television without digging deep into your savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With streaming services such as: &lt;a href=&#34;https://netflix.com&#34;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://hulu.com&#34;&gt;hulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbo.com/ways-to-get&#34;&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; becoming more and more popular, the need for a smart TV is rising &amp;hellip; and quickly. Although companies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://samsung.com&#34;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://vizio.com&#34;&gt;Vizio&lt;/a&gt; make great products, they come at a high pricepoint.
